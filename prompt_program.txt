########################agent_pompts.py/SYSTEM_MESSAGE_PREFIX###############
You are ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.
\nYou are now act as a mature driving assistant, who can give accurate
and correct advice for human driver in complex urban driving scenarios.
\n\nTOOLS:\n------\nYou have access to the following tools:

########################customTools.py/getAvailableActions;getAvailableLanes;.;.;..;.;########################
\n\n\nGet Available Actions: Useful before you make decisions, this tool
let you know what are your available actions in this situation. The input
to this tool should be 'ego'.
\nGet Available Lanes: useful when you want to
know the available lanes of the vehicles. like: I want to know the available
lanes of the vehicle `ego`. The input to this tool should be a string,
representing the id of the vehicle.
\nGet Lane Involved Car: useful when
want to know the cars may affect your action in the certain lane. Make sure
you have use tool `Get Available Lanes` first. The input is a string, representing
the id of the specific lane you want to drive on, DONNOT input multiple lane_id once.
\nIs Change Lane Confict With Car: useful when you want to know whether change lane
to a specific lane is confict with a specific car, ONLY when your decision is
change_lane_left or change_lane_right. The input to this tool should be a string
of a comma separated string of two, representing the id of the lane you want to
change to and the id of the car you want to check.
\nIs Acceleration Conflict With Car: useful when you want to know whether acceleration
is safe with a specific car, ONLY when your decision is accelerate. The input to
this tool should be a string, representing the id of the car you want to check.
\nIs Keep Speed Conflict With Car: useful when you want to know whether keep speed
is safe with a specific car, ONLY when your decision is keep_speed. The input to
this tool should be a string, representing the id of the car you want to check.
\nIs Deceleration Safe: useful when you want to know whether deceleration is safe,
ONLY when your decision is decelerate.The input to this tool should be a string,
representing the id of the car you want to check.
\nDecision-making Instructions:
This tool gives you a brief intruduction about how to ensure that the action you make
is safe. The input to this tool should be a string, which is ONLY the action name.

########################agent_propmts.py/FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS########################
\n\nThe way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.\nSpecifically, this json
should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input`
key (with the input to the tool going here).\nThe only values that should be in the
\"action\" field are one of:
Get Available Actions, Get Available Lanes, Get Lane Involved Car, Is Change Lane
Confict With Car, Is Acceleration Conflict With Car, Is Keep Speed Conflict With Car,
Is Deceleration Safe, Decision-making Instructions\n\n
The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions.
Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:\n```\n
{\n  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,\n  \"action_input\":
$INPUT\n}\n```\n
\nALWAYS use the following format when you use tool:
\nQuestion: the input question you must answer
\nThought: always summarize the tools you have used and
think what to do next step by step\nAction:\n```\n$JSON_BLOB\n```
\nObservation: the result of the action\n...
(this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)\n\nWhen
you have a final answer, you MUST use the format:\nThought: I now know the final answer,
 then summary why you have this answer
 \nFinal Answer: the final answer to the original
 input question\n\nBegin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer`
 when responding.\nHuman: \n

 You, the 'ego' car, are now driving a car on a highway. You have already drive for
 0 seconds.\n                The decision you made LAST time step was `Not available`.
 Your explanation was `Not available`. \n
 Here is the current scenario:
  \n ```json\n{\"lanes\": [
{\"id\": \"lane_0\", \"lane index\": 0, \"left_lanes\": [],\"right_lanes\": [\"lane_1\", \"lane_2\", \"lane_3\"]}, 
{\"id\": \"lane_1\",\"lane index\": 1, \"left_lanes\": [\"lane_0\"], \"right_lanes\": [\"lane_2\", \"lane_3\"]}, 
{\"id\": \"lane_2\", \"lane index\": 2,\"left_lanes\": [\"lane_0\", \"lane_1\"], \"right_lanes\": [\"lane_3\"]},
{\"id\": \"lane_3\", \"lane index\": 3, \"left_lanes\": [\"lane_0\", \"lane_1\",\"lane_2\"], \"right_lanes\": []}], 
\"vehicles\": [{\"id\": \"ego\", \"current lane\":\"lane_1\", \"lane position\": 30.0, \"speed\": 30.0}, 
{\"id\": \"veh1\",\"current lane\": \"lane_0\", \"lane position\": 5.0, \"speed\": 31.5},
{\"id\": \"veh2\", \"current lane\": \"lane_1\", \"lane position\": 70.0, \"speed\": 31.0},
{\"id\": \"veh3\", \"current lane\": \"lane_0\", \"lane position\": 90.0, \"speed\": 29.0},
{\"id\": \"veh4\", \"current lane\": \"lane_4\", \"lane position\": 110.0, \"speed\": 20.0}], 
\"ego_info\": {\"id\": \"ego\", \"current lane\": \"lane_1\", \"lane position\": 30.0, \"speed\": 30.0}}\n```\n. \n
    Please make decision for the `ego` car. You have to describe the state of the `ego`, then analyze the possible actions, and finally output your decision. \n\n
There are several rules you need to follow when you drive on a highway:\n

#############################agent_propmts.py/TRAFFIC_RULES####################################################
\n1. Try to keep a safe distance to the car in front of you.
\n2. If there is no safe decision, just slowing down.
\n3. DONOT change lane frequently. If you want to change lane, double-check the safety of vehicles on target lane.
\n4. \n\n\n


#############################agent_propmts.py/DECISION_CAUTIONS####################################################
Here are your attentions points:\n
\n1. DONOT finish the task until you have a final answer. You must output a decision when you finish this task. Your final output decision must be unique and not ambiguous. For example you cannot say \"I can either keep lane or accelerate at current time\".
\n2. You can only use tools mentioned before to help you make decision. DONOT fabricate any other tool name not mentioned.
\n3. Remember what tools you have used, DONOT use the same tool repeatedly.\n3. You need to know your available actions and available lanes before you make any decision.
\n4. Once you have a decision, you should check the safety with all the vehicles affected by your decision. Once it's safe, stop using tools and output it.
\n5. If you verify a decision is unsafe, you should start a new one and verify its safety again from scratch.\n\n                
#让我们一步一步来思考。一旦你做出最终决策，请以以下格式输出：\n


#############################self.agent.run()####################################################
Let's think step by step. Once you made a final decision, output it in the following format: \n\n                ```\n
Final Answer: \n
\"decision\":{\"ego car's decision, ONE of the available actions\"},\n
\"expalanations\":{\"your explaination about your decision, described your suggestions to the driver\"}\n                ```"

This was your previous work (but I haven't seen any of it! I only see what you return as final answer):
\nThought: \nThe ego car is currently driving in lane 1 with a speed of 31.66 m/s. There are three lanes to the right of the ego car (lane 2, lane 3, and lane 4) and one lane to the left (lane 0). There are four other vehicles on the road: veh1 in lane 0, veh2 in lane 1, veh3 in lane 0, and veh4 in lane 4. \n
\nTo make a decision, I need to first check the available actions for the ego car and the available lanes. Then, I will analyze the possible actions and their safety implications. \n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Get Available Actions\",\n  \"action_input\": \"ego\"\n}\n```\nObservation: You can ONLY use one of the following actions: \nIDLE--remain in the current lane with current speed; \nLANE_LEFT--change lane to the left of the current lane,; \nSLOWER--decelerate the vehicle; \nYou should check idle action as FIRST priority. For change lane action, CAREFULLY CHECK the safety of vehicles on target lane. The deceleration action is LAST priority. 
\nTo check decision safety you should follow steps:\n        
Step 1: Get the vehicles in this lane that you may affect. Acceleration, deceleration and idle action affect the current lane, while left and right lane changes affect the corresponding lane.\n        
Step 2: If there are vehicles, check safety between ego and all vehicles in the action lane ONE by ONE.\n        Remember to use the proper tools mentioned in the tool list ONCE a time.\n        \nThought:"

\nThought:The available actions for the ego car are IDLE, LANE_LEFT, and SLOWER. \n\nNow, let's analyze the possible actions and their safety implications:\n\n1. 
IDLE: This action means the ego car will remain in the current lane with the current speed. Since the ego car is already in lane 1, this action does not involve any lane changes. We need to check the safety with the vehicles in the current lane.\n\n2. 
LANE_LEFT: This action means the ego car will change to the left lane. We need to check the safety with the vehicles in the left lane (lane 0).\n\n3. SLOWER: This action means the ego car will decelerate. We need to check the safety with the vehicles in the current lane.
\n\nTo make a decision, we need to check the safety of each action with the vehicles involved. Let's start by checking the safety of the IDLE action with the vehicles in the current lane.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Get Lane Involved Car\",\n  \"action_input\": \"lane_1\"\n}\n```\n

\nObservation: veh2 is driving at 25.1m/s on lane_1, and it's driving in front of ego car for 37.20000076293945 meters. You need to make sure that your actions do not conflict with each of the vehicles mentioned.\nThought:",


\nThought:","The vehicles involved in the current lane (lane 1) are veh2. We need to check the safety of the IDLE action with veh2.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Is Keep Speed Conflict With Car\",\n  \"action_input\": \"veh2\"\n}\n```\n\n",
\nObservation: keep lane with current speed may be conflict with veh2, you need consider decelerate\nThought:",

\nThought:",The IDLE action (keeping the current lane with the current speed) may conflict with veh2. Therefore, we need to consider decelerating to maintain a safe distance from veh2. \n\nNext, let's check the safety of the LANE_LEFT action with the vehicles in the left lane (lane 0).\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Get Lane Involved Car\",\n  \"action_input\": \"lane_0\"\n}\n```\n\n"
\nObservation: veh3 and veh1 is driving on lane_0, and veh3 is driving at 23.8m/s in front of ego car for 55.33000183105469 meters, while veh1 is driving behind ego car. You need to make sure that your actions do not conflict with each of the vehicles mentioned.


\nThought:The vehicles involved in the left lane (lane 0) are veh3 and veh1. We need to check the safety of the LANE_LEFT action with these vehicles.\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Is Change Lane Confict With Car\",\n  \"action_input\": \"lane_0,veh3\"\n}\n```\n\n
\nObservation: change lane to `lane_0` is safe with `veh3`.

\nThought:The LANE_LEFT action (changing to the left lane) is safe with veh3. \n\nNow, let's check the safety of the SLOWER action with the vehicles in the current lane.\n
\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Get Lane Involved Car\",\n  \"action_input\": \"lane_1\"\n}\n```\n\n
\nObservation: veh2 is driving at 25.1m/s on lane_1, and it's driving in front of ego car for 37.20000076293945 meters. You need to make sure that your actions do not conflict with each of the vehicles mentioned.

\nThought:The vehicles involved in the current lane (lane 1) are veh2. We need to check the safety of the SLOWER action with veh2.
\n\nAction:\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"Is Deceleration Safe\",\n  \"action_input\": \"veh2\"\n}\n```\n\n\n
\nObservation: deceleration with current speed is safe with veh2\

nThought:"The SLOWER action (decelerating) is safe with veh2.\n\nBased on the safety analysis, the IDLE action conflicts with veh2, so it is not a safe option. The LANE_LEFT action is safe with veh3, but we need to consider the safety with veh1 as well. The SLOWER action is safe with veh2.\n\nConsidering the safety implications, the best decision for the ego car is to choose the SLOWER action and decelerate to maintain a safe distance from veh2.\n\nFinal Answer: \n```\n{\n  \"decision\": \"SLOWER\",\n  \"explanations\": \"Decelerate to maintain a safe distance from veh2.\"\n}\n```"

Final decision:
The SLOWER action (decelerating) is safe with veh2.

Based on the safety analysis, the IDLE action conflicts with veh2, so it is not
a safe option. The LANE_LEFT action is safe with veh3, but we need to consider 
the safety with veh1 as well. The SLOWER action is safe with veh2.

Considering the safety implications, the best decision for the ego car is to 
choose the SLOWER action and decelerate to maintain a safe distance from veh2.
